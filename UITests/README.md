# Asserted app journeys

XCUITest drives real screens for wallet creation, recovery, receiving, sending,
people, shared savings, and Advanced signing. These tests check the combined app,
wallet, and node behavior that isolated unit tests cannot establish.

[WinnowAppUITests.swift](WinnowAppUITests.swift) contains the scenarios.
[The journey inventory](../docs/journeys.json) maps them to the public website;
[build-site](../scripts/build-site) validates selectors and named screenshot captures.
[Node support](../Tests/Support/Node/README.md) supplies transactions and mined blocks.

[Node CI](../.github/workflows/node-tests.yml) creates a disposable signet and
uploads the result bundle, screenshots, and timing observations.
[The testing guide](../docs/testing.html) explains those artifacts and limits.
Screenshots do not turn a failed assertion into a pass; simulator evidence does
not establish physical-device behavior.
