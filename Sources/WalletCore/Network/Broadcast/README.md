# Payment relay

TxBroadcaster announces signed payments, handles peer fee filters and retry
state, and retains enough history to relay a payment again after a chain reorg.
The app needs this to distinguish a signed payment from one actually announced.

[AppModel](../../../WinnowApp/AppModel.swift) coordinates relay with the
wallet and [mempool observations](../Mempool/README.md).
This is one part of WalletCore networking, not a separate backend.

[Relay tests](../../../../Tests/WalletCoreTests/Network/TxBroadcasterTests.swift) exercise
announcements and retry policy. [Store tests](../../../../Tests/WalletCoreTests/Network/TxBroadcasterStoreTests.swift)
cover damaged persistence and reorg recovery. [App journeys](../../../../UITests/README.md)
check the resulting payment history against a node.
