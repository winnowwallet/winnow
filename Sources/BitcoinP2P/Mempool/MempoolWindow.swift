/// A bounded mempool window (docs/read-side.md §2.8): a time- and
/// screen-bounded subscription to *full transaction relay*. While the window
/// is open, every transaction `inv` from the pool's connected peers is
/// answered with `getdata(MSG_WITNESS_TX)`, and the fetched transactions are
/// matched locally against a watch set of scriptPubKeys (typically the one
/// address currently displayed).
///
/// Privacy: nothing is queried and nothing is revealed — the client receives
/// public gossip, and a node that fetches every relayed transaction is
/// indistinguishable from an ordinary full node. The relay bit
/// (`relayPreference`) is a connect-time parameter of the pool's connections
/// (PeerPool/PeerConnection); this actor bounds the expensive part: with no
/// window open, invs are dropped by PeerConnection's bounded backlog and no
/// getdata is ever sent.
///
/// Lifecycle: `start(duration:)` opens the window (default 20 minutes),
/// `extend(by:)` pushes the deadline out, `stop()` closes it — cancelling the
/// peer listeners and the expiry sweep. Peers that disconnect mid-window are
/// forgotten; the sweep task re-attaches to replacement peers the pool
/// connects.
///
/// Bounds by construction: announced txids dedupe through a capped
/// FIFO set (`maxSeenTxids`), in-flight getdata requests are capped
/// (`maxInFlight`) and time out (`requestTimeout`), and a fetched tx is
/// matched at most once.
