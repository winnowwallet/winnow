# Wallet and network reference data

These fixtures provide BIP158 filters, BIP341 signing examples, controlled DNS
replies, and real mainnet headers. They give wallet/network tests stable inputs
without querying a changing public service during each run.

[SighashBIP341Tests](../SighashBIP341Tests.swift),
[PeerPolicyTests](../Network/PeerPolicyTests.swift), and
[HeaderChainTests](../Network/HeaderChainTests.swift) are consumers.
SwiftPM copies the directory into the test resource bundle.

Refresh Bitcoin vectors from their named specifications and record the source
revision; DNS JSON files are deliberately controlled response fixtures.
The 2,000-header file is produced by the [checkpoint generator](../../../Tools/Generate/README.md)
from a genesis-validated header file. Preserve that provenance and run
`swift test --filter WalletCoreTests`; do not replace expected data just to make tests pass.
