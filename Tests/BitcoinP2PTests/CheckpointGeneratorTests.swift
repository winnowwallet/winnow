/// Regenerates the shipped mainnet checkpoint from a header file this code

/// The point of the checkpoint is that nobody has to take it on faith. So it is
/// not derived by a separate parser that could agree with the constant while
/// both are wrong — the header file is loaded through `HeaderChain` itself,
/// which proof-of-work-checks every header and rejects a broken chain. What the
/// app would compute is what gets compared.
///
/// To run it:
///
///     WINNOW_HEADERS_BIN=~/…/mainnet/headers.bin \
///       swift test --filter CheckpointGenerator
///
/// Any genesis-validated mainnet `headers.bin` past height 900,000 works,
/// including one from a simulator container. Without the variable the suite
/// skips, so CI stays green without shipping a 77 MB fixture.
