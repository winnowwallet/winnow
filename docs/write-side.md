# The Write Side: How a Phone Pays Without Asking Anyone

*Design paper for Winnow. Companion to [the read side](read-side.md) — that paper ends when the UTXOs are local. This one starts there. Framing: [a phone wallet](mobile.md).*

## 1. The problem

Once compact filters have answered "what's mine?", spending is four mechanical steps:

1. **Choose coins and a feerate** so the transaction clears dust rules and will relay.
2. **Build** an unsigned transaction whose change is not a fingerprint.
3. **Sign** without leaving the seed in memory or in a file.
4. **Get it out** — and know that it got out — without an API key and without calling the spend "received" at 0-conf.

On a server-backed wallet these collapse to `POST /tx`. On a phone that refuses that server, each step has to be possible with only: the local UTXO set, a handful of outbound peers, and the keychain. This paper is those four steps, as implemented.

---

## 2. One spend shape

Everyday spends are BIP86 P2TR key-path. The signed witness is one 64-byte Schnorr signature (`SIGHASH_DEFAULT`); fee math uses 66 witness bytes per input (compact-size count + length + 64). Script-path and MuSig2 shapes belong to [vaults](vaults.md) and plug into the same builder via `witnessBytesPerInput`.

The phone *receives* only P2TR. It *pays* any standard address (bech32 / bech32m, base58 P2PKH / P2SH) and BIP352 silent-payment codes. Destination diversity is a payment-layer concern; the wallet's own outputs stay one type so coin selection, change, and watch-list code have a single script shape.

Transactions are version 2, empty `scriptSig`s, and sequence `0xFFFFFFFD` (locktime-disabled, BIP125 opt-in RBF). Replace-by-fee is signaled even though the first-cut UI does not yet offer a bump — a stuck transaction must be replaceable later without a policy surprise.

---

## 3. Coin selection and change

Largest-first, with Bitcoin Core's dust rule (`policy.cpp` `GetDustThreshold`). At the default dust relay feerate (3000 sat/kvB) a 43-byte P2TR output is dust below **330 sats**. The often-quoted 294 sats is the P2WPKH threshold; using it here would produce outputs some peers will not relay.

The loop accumulates the largest UTXOs until the selection covers the payment plus the fee of the transaction *as currently shaped* (each added input grows vsize, so the fee target moves). A change output is created when the remainder clears the change script's dust threshold; otherwise the remainder is folded into the fee. Feerates outside `(0, 10_000]` sat/vB are rejected (Core's `maxTxFee` ceiling is 0.10 BTC/kvB). Payment outputs that are themselves dust are rejected before a transaction is built — a sub-dust payment would strand the inputs in a tx no peer will take.

Change, when any, goes to the next unused internal address (`tr(…/<0;1>/*)`, choice 1). Its position among the outputs is chosen uniformly at random so change is not "always last" — a well-known chain-analysis fingerprint. After a successful broadcast the spent UTXOs leave the local set immediately and the change UTXO enters it at height 0, so a second send cannot double-spend the unconfirmed inputs. Height 0 is pending, never "confirmed."

**Commit-after-broadcast.** `Wallet.buildSend` produces a signed transaction without mutating wallet state. `commit` runs only after the bytes have been handed to the broadcaster. Committing first and then failing to leave the device would strand inputs in a locally-spent, on-chain-unspent limbo that forward-only scanning cannot repair.

---

## 4. Fees without a mempool

A filter-only client does not see the fee market. Feerates of stranger transactions require their input amounts, which means recursively fetching parents — the bandwidth blowup the read side refused. So this product does not estimate from gossip.

Resolution, strongest first (`FeePolicy`):

1. **User override** (sat/vB), when the send form set one.
2. **Median of this wallet's own recently confirmed spends.** Those feerates are exact: the wallet knows every input amount because it selected them.
3. **Static presets** — low 2, medium 5, high 12 sat/vB. Deliberately above typical minima. A mempool-blind wallet must overpay rather than stall.

The result is clamped from below by the strictest BIP133 `feefilter` among connected peers (the minimum that will relay at all). If every remaining peer's floor later rises above a pending transaction's feerate, the broadcaster emits `feeFloorExceeded` once; the caller decides whether to bump. There is no live histogram and no "arrives in 10 minutes" claim.

This is cruder than any mempool-aware estimator. It is also the only estimator that does not reintroduce a server or a persistent relay subscription. Owned, and said in the send UI as a rate, not as a promise.

## 5. Signing

The everyday path is PSBTv2 even for single-sig (BIP370/371): creator attaches witness UTXOs and Taproot key-origin metadata, the signer writes `PSBT_IN_TAP_KEY_SIG`, the finalizer extracts a raw transaction. One pipeline with [vaults](vaults.md), instead of a private "just sign it" shortcut that would drift.

Secrets:

- The seed is a BIP39 mnemonic (12 words, 16 bytes of entropy) or a master xprv, stored by `KeychainStore` under the wallet id (master fingerprint, 8 hex chars).
- Accessibility is `WhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly`; `kSecAttrSynchronizable` is false. The JSON wallet file on disk holds the descriptor, UTXOs, and history — public material.
- `Wallet.tweakedPrivateKey` loads the secret, derives `m/86'/coin'/account'/chain/index`, applies the BIP86 tweak (no merkle root), signs, and drops the key. The actor never holds the seed in `WalletState`.

All secret-key operations go through libsecp256k1 (P256K). The sighash is BIP341 `SIGHASH_DEFAULT` — also the BIP352-safe choice for taproot inputs, which matters in §6. Auxiliary nonce randomness is 32 fresh bytes per signature.

A server that lied about a UTXO *amount* on the (opt-in) esplora path produces an invalid signature, not a theft: the sighash commits to input amounts. A server that hid a payment can only hide it; it cannot spend it. The default path never asks a server.

---

## 6. Silent payments, send-side only

BIP352 `sp1…` / `tsp1…` codes are first-class destinations. The P2TR output script is not known until the input set is fixed — the shared secret is `input_hash · a · B_scan` over the selected inputs' tweaked keys — so coin selection runs against a same-size P2TR *placeholder*, then `SilentPaymentSending.outputScripts` replaces the placeholders at signing time.

Receiving silent payments is out of scope. A receiver must tweak-check every output in every block, which is a different read-side (and a different battery budget) than matching a small watch list against BIP158 filters. The product does not pretend a send-only implementation is "silent payments support." Send is done and vector-tested; receive is a deliberate absence, recorded in [the read side](read-side.md) §3.

Inputs to a silent-payment send are this wallet's own P2TR key-path spends, which is exactly the BIP352 wallet case (the sender controls every eligible input key; shared-control inputs are excluded from derivation).

## 7. Getting it out

`TxBroadcaster` is P2P relay, not an API client:

- Announce `inv(MSG_WITNESS_TX)` to the connected pool (default 3 peers).
- Answer `getdata` with the raw transaction.
- Per-peer state: `announced → requested → served`, plus `failed` on timeout/disconnect and `deprioritized` if a peer never answers `maxAnnouncementsPerPeer` invs (then skipped for that tx).
- Re-announce on exponential backoff (60s base, cap 1h) until `FilterSync` reports the tx in a matched block, or the caller cancels (e.g. a replacement).
- Pending txs persist as JSON (raw tx, feerate, next attempt) so a killed app resumes relay.

While the Send screen is open, a [bounded mempool window](read-side.md#28-bounded-mempool-windows) watches for peers echoing our txid back. An echo is evidence the network has the bytes; it is not confirmation. The UI says "broadcast" / "relayed" / "seen in a block", never "sent" at 0-conf.

The opt-in esplora path may POST the same raw transaction as a second route. That POST links the txid to the phone's IP at that server — one of the things the Settings warning names.

---

## 8. What still leaks

Filters protect the *read*. The write is a public announcement.

- The peers you `inv` see your IP and your transaction. They learn the inputs you spend and the outputs you create. Change randomization and Taproot-only outputs shrink fingerprints; they do not hide the spend from the relay peer.
- A network observer between you and those peers sees the same.
- RBF signaling and a recognizable vsize (one 64-byte witness per input) are visible on the wire. That is the cost of a simple spend shape.

There is no Dandelion, no Tor requirement, no equal-output coinjoin. A user who needs those wants a different product (or a vault plus a coordinator they bring themselves). This paper will not claim broadcast privacy the implementation does not provide.

## 9. Use cases

| # | Use case | Mechanism |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Pay a bech32m / bech32 / base58 address | Decode → select → build (random change slot) → PSBT sign → broadcast |
| 2 | Pay a silent-payment code | Same, with output scripts derived after selection |
| 3 | Pick a fee | Override / observed median / preset, clamped by `feefilter` |
| 4 | "Is it out?" | Peer `getdata` + txid echo while Send is open |
| 5 | "Is it done?" | Filter match on a confirmed block; height 0 change flips to that height |
| 6 | App killed mid-relay | Persisted pending set resumes backoff |
| 7 | Peers will not take this feerate | `feeFloorExceeded`; user may bump (RBF already signaled) |
| 8 | Vault spend | Same builder and broadcaster; signing is the [vault](vaults.md) ceremony |

## 10. Conclusion

The write side of a phone wallet is not a REST client. It is coin selection that knows P2TR dust, a feerate that admits it is blind, a signing path that holds the seed for one call, and a relay state machine that survives the app being killed. Confirmation still comes from [the read side](read-side.md). Nothing in this paper asks a server, unless the user turned one on and was told what that means.

**v1 is therefore: largest-first P2TR selection + `FeePolicy` + PSBTv2 key-path signing via libsecp256k1 + `TxBroadcaster` over the same peer pool that serves filters.**
