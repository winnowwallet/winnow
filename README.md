# Winnow

A Bitcoin wallet for iOS with on-device compact-filter matching, written in Swift.

**[Download on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6801502501)** — pre-release builds ship through [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/83djpNE7). Mainnet by default; signet is one Advanced-mode toggle away. See the [roadmap](https://winnowwallet.com/roadmap) for the status of earlier proposals.

- **Pure P2P by default.** The read side is BIP157/158 compact block filters served by full-node peers — the wallet does not send its watch list to a wallet-history server. Peers still observe requests, relay traffic and connection metadata. Bounded **mempool windows** (short full-relay subscriptions while the Receive or Send screen is open) give 0-conf payment detection and propagation tracking without any server. Read [how it works](docs/architecture.html).
- **Taproot today.** Ordinary receiving uses P2TR (BIP86); shared accounts use MuSig2 key-path or threshold script-path signing. There is no ECDSA signing path or P2WSH Safe.
- **Pay people and share control.** Save a public payment card or Bitcoin address. From Wallet, create shared savings with a threshold such as 2-of-3: any two keys can spend while one is unavailable. A 1-of-n policy permits one key to spend. Cards carry public keys only.
- **Require another signing device.** Advanced mode offers MuSig2 accounts where every key must participate. The single integration journey receives and sends with a phone-plus-Core account, followed by a script-path 2-of-3 account. Focused tests check wallet and account rules. Hardware-wallet compatibility needs its own test. Read about [shared signing and its limits](docs/vaults.html).
- **Bitcoin cryptography:** [`swift-secp256k1`](https://github.com/21-DOT-DEV/swift-secp256k1) (Bitcoin Core's libsecp256k1), pinned; the only third-party dependency. The embedded Tor client shipped in 0.6 through 0.7.0 was removed in 0.7.1 (its source is kept on the `archive/tor-0.7.0` branch); Tor and I2P are historical proposals, not current features or scheduled work.
- **Warned explorer links** — choose mempool.space or a custom Esplora website; Winnow opens it only after a tap and privacy warning, never as a wallet backend.

## Release roadmap

The [public roadmap](https://winnowwallet.com/roadmap) separates current behavior
from proposals that are not scheduled. It does not promise a release date or
make the historical audit follow-ups into current requirements.

## Layout

The app, Bitcoin implementation, CLI, fuzz harness, debugging tools and website
live in this repository. The app and all development tools use one root
Swift package and dependency lockfile. There is one release version and one source revision.

The app owns the user flows. WalletCore contains Bitcoin primitives, wallet
state, and P2P networking in one target. The winnow-debug tool and fuzz harness
use that same implementation. Explorer links open an external website after a warning.

The [testing and feature policy](docs/testing.md) keeps one iPhone integration
journey: an ordinary receive/send, MuSig2 receive/send with one Core cosigner,
then script-path 2-of-3 receive/send with two Core cosigners available. The phone
and one Core key approve the 2-of-3 payment; the third key stays unused. The
private signet fixture mines blocks automatically for prompt confirmation.
App, wallet, and protocol tests cover detailed rules; there is no separate
DifferentialTests target or broad interoperability matrix. One continuous
video presents the journey on the [recording page](https://winnowwallet.com/recording).
The automated UI journey currently runs only on iPhone; it does not establish
iPad UI coverage. The homepage gives an overview, illustrates
the signing choices, shows the run's sixteen checkpoint screenshots in order,
and links to the full recording. Detailed guidance and test evidence live on
separate pages.
`scripts/build-site` generates home and the recording page.
Run it after changing docs/journeys.json or the app test
source. CI rejects missing or undocumented app scenarios.

## Directory guides

Each guide explains what its directory owns, why the app or debugging needs it,
and which consumers and tests support that purpose. Every guide links back here.
When adding an owned directory with code, data, or documentation, add its README
and index link together. Parent folders with their own files need a guide too;
asset catalogs are documented by their owner, outside the bundle.

## Build & test

```sh
swift test
swift run winnow-debug inspect tx <hex>
xcodegen
scripts/ci-app-tests /tmp/winnow-app-tests
scripts/ci-debug
```

Use XcodeGen 2.46.0. `scripts/install-xcodegen` downloads and verifies that
version; locally it prints the executable path to use. The generated Xcode
project is ignored. Run app tests with a fresh results directory.
Test fixtures live once, in the `TestSupport` library
([`Tests/Support`](Tests/Support/README.md)); it imports neither `Testing` nor
`XCTest`, so the swift-testing targets and the Xcode bundles share it and every
assertion stays at the call site.
`scripts/check-dependencies --xcode /path/to/DerivedData` verifies that Xcode uses the root
package and its committed third-party dependency revision.

[CI and release operations](.github/internal/ci-release.md) describes the shared
validation gates, node fixture, TestFlight recovery and website deployment.
CI has one GitHub-hosted Apple silicon (`macos-26`) `build` job for package,
app, fuzz, lint, and release checks, followed by a `website` job that deploys
its ready artifact. Fresh runs use per-run build products and a new signet
fixture, with no dependence on a developer Mac. One Debug build serves app
unit tests and the signet journey on the same simulator. Fresh runs retain both
result bundles, the video, and screenshots in `app-tests-…`.
Website-only edits reuse normalized journey media from a successful run with
matching test and build inputs, then generate and check a fresh website.
App-bundled HTML/CSS changes still require fresh tests. Missing evidence runs
the full checks; manual, nightly, and release runs always run fresh.

Mainnet is the default network, and the app starts in beginner mode: one
screen with the balance, Receive, Send, your activity, shared savings once you
have any, and the backup — no settings. Open a payment to save or rename its
recipient, then pick them from Saved recipients in Send. The same Send form
handles every account: choose the account, recipient, and amount, then review
the fee. Shared accounts continue to their required approvals before anything
is sent. Advanced, in the corner of that screen, switches to the three-tab
interface — Wallet, Send, Settings — with the test network, your own peers,
chain verification, the block explorer, custom fees, fee bumping, build
details and the raw vault tools; Simple, on the Wallet tab, switches back and
keeps every setting. Switch to signet there for development. Point the app at
your own filter-serving node (Settings → Manual peers); the node needs
`blockfilterindex=1` and `peerblockfilters=1`.

## App demonstration

GUI diagnostics live in [Tools/Debug](Tools/Debug/README.md). Use
`scripts/winnow-debug doctor` for environment checks and
`scripts/winnow-debug diagnostics` for local simulator logs and screenshots.
The demo and publication workflow has been retired. The single
`test01CreateReceiveSendConfirm` journey in `UITests/WinnowAppUITests.swift`
covers ordinary, MuSig2, and script-path 2-of-3 payments on iPhone. The host
records one continuous video; checkpoint screenshots remain secondary artifacts.
Lower-level tests cover detailed feature behavior. The recording’s provenance
identifies exactly which version and payments it shows.

Screenshot PNGs in `docs/screenshots/` are stored in Git LFS. After cloning,
install Git LFS and download the image objects before viewing or publishing them:

```sh
git lfs install --local
git lfs pull
```

The build job fetches LFS objects and prepares a fresh website artifact with
either its new journey or cached normalized video and all 16 screenshots.
Cached media keeps the original recording's provenance. The website job deploys
that same-run artifact without rebuilding: trusted PRs get previews and `main`
gets production. Local test runs use fresh temporary directories; committed
historical images remain in LFS.
